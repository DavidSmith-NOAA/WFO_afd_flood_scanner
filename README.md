Files included:
Jupyter Notebook File with the script.
WFO List as excel file used to loop through the different Westher Forecast Office Discussions. 

File not included: The WFO Shape File. I used a file called w_10nv20.shp which is the CWA area used in the creating the graphical display of the areas. The file is very large so I could not add it. 
I would suggest downloading another CWA shapefile shuch as the one one found here: https://www.weather.gov/gis/PublicZones
The shapefile name will have to be updated in the code.
